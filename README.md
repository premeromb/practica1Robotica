# practica1Robotica

This repository contains the progress made by the group G10-X2 for the subject of robotics (degree in computer engineering). The aim is to develop components with different functions for Robocomp.

    Authors: Pablo Romero Muñoz and Alejandro Rodríguez De La Cruz.

## First practice [/practica1]

It includes the development of a simple counter using the Qtcreator interface and the time.h library.

## Second practice [/practica2]

The aim is to create a component for our vacuuming robot. The objective is to implement the necessary algorithms to use the robot's laser to cover the largest possible area of the room in a given time. In the generated room there will be obstacles in random positions to which the movement must be adapted. 

## Third practice [/practice3]

Once ready the movement of the robot, it is raised that this can go to a position marked with the mouse on the room of the simulator, without contemplating obstacles. After it the robot calculates the position of the point marked according to its point of view and it is directed toward it. In the development it is has sought a soft movement, without states and adaptable to new objectives in the transit until to reach it.

## Fourth practice [/practica4]

Evolution of the previous one where besides reaching the objective, it must deal with obstacles in the way. making use of movement planning based on artificial potential fields. ( in process of being finalized )
